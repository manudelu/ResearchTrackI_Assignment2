Create and setup a Catkin Workspace
--------------------------------

The ROS (or Catkin) Workspace will allow us to correctly organize and package our application. We start in our home directory, to create the workspace we simply create a new folder called `catkin_ws` with the command `mkdir`:

```bash
mkdir catkin_ws
```
